            <h2>Introduction to IGP</h2>
            <p>IGP (Internationale Gebrauchshunde Prüfungsordnung) is an international canine sport that evaluates obedience, tracking, and protection skills.

    <section id="history">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>History of IGP</h2>
            <p>IGP originated in Germany as a selection test for working dogs, designed to evaluate their obedience, tracking, and protection abilities. Over time, it became an internationally recognized sport by the FCI (Fédération Cynologique Internationale), maintaining its focus on the dog’s capability and preparation, as well as the relationship with the handler.</p>
            <p>Since its first championships, IGP has evolved to include more precise rules, welfare assessments, and correct, respectful training techniques.</p>

A correctly trained dog receives better assessments, promoting respectful and healthy training practices. This ensures the sport not only measures performance but also encourages animal welfare.</p>
