            <h1>What is IGP?</h1>
            <p>Discover the IGP canine sport: disciplines, rules, and the importance of the bond between dog and handler.</p>

    <!-- INTRO SECTION -->
    <section id="intro">
        <h2>Introduction to IGP</h2>
        <p>IGP (Internationale Gebrauchshunde Prüfungsordnung) is an international canine sport that evaluates obedience, tracking, and protection skills. It promotes a relationship of respect and collaboration between dog and handler, emphasizing both skill and animal welfare.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- HISTORY -->
    <section id="history">
        <h2>History of IGP</h2>
        <p>IGP originated in Germany as a selection test for working dogs, aimed at assessing their abilities in obedience, tracking, and protection. Over time, it evolved into an internationally recognized sport by the FCI (Fédération Cynologique Internationale), maintaining its focus on the dog's abilities and preparation as well as the relationship with its handler.</p>
        <p>Since the first international championships, IGP has evolved to include precise rules, welfare evaluations, and correct, respectful training methods.</p>

    <!-- DISCIPLINES -->
    <section id="disciplines">
        <h2>Main Disciplines</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Obedience:</strong> Precision, control, and execution of commands.</li>
            <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> The dog's ability to follow a scent and locate objects or specific signals.</li>
            <li><strong>Protection:</strong> Controlled defense tests under the handler's supervision, focused on the dog's skills and control.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- PHILOSOPHY -->
    <section id="philosophy">
        <h2>IGP Philosophy</h2>
        <p>Beyond evaluating physical and technical skills, IGP also observes the dog's overall condition. A dog trained correctly, without excessive coercion, receives higher evaluations, promoting respectful and healthy training practices. This ensures the sport measures performance while encouraging animal welfare.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- DOG-HANDLER BOND -->
    <section id="bond">
        <h2>Importance of the Dog-Handler Bond</h2>
        <p>Mutual trust and effective communication are essential. Success in IGP depends as much on the dog's physical and mental preparation as on the handler's ability to motivate and guide it correctly.</p>
