            <h1>What is IGP?</h1>
            <p>The IGP (Internationale Gebrauchshunde Prüfungsordnung) is an international canine sport that evaluates obedience, tracking, and protection. It promotes a respectful and cooperative relationship between dog and handler, highlighting both physical skills and animal welfare.</p>

            <!-- HISTORY -->
            <section id="history">
                <h2>History of IGP</h2>
                <p>IGP originated in Germany as a selection test for working dogs, designed to assess their skills in obedience, tracking, and protection. Over time, it became an internationally recognized sport by the FCI (Fédération Cynologique Internationale), maintaining its focus on the dog’s abilities and preparation, as well as the handler-dog relationship.</p>
                <p>Since the first championships, IGP has evolved to include more precise standards, welfare evaluations, and correct and respectful training techniques.</p>

                <h2>IGP Philosophy</h2>
                <p>Beyond assessing physical and technical skills, IGP also considers the dog’s overall condition. A properly trained dog achieves better evaluations, promoting respectful and healthy training practices. This ensures the sport measures performance while also encouraging animal welfare.</p>

                <p>Mutual trust and effective communication are essential. Success in IGP depends on both the dog’s physical and mental preparation and the handler’s ability to motivate and guide the dog correctly.</p>
